# LDN_UT2_Task_1

Task 1 involves the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this project, I have created HTML and CSS documents based on an image from Dribbble.


## Getting Started

Read the following instructions to download and view the documents.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a computer that can download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and a web browser to view the document.

### Installing



1.  

    Download Visual Studio Code and install the "Live Preview" extension.

2.  

    Open the files in the folder using Visual Studio Code.

3.  
  
    Open the `index.html` file to view it in your browser.

*Optional:* You can also use the extension's preview feature located in the upper-right corner.
